This is a React-based web application made to explore NASA's data collection using [NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/). The idea behind this project was to gain more experience with React, focusing on routing, global state management, custom hooks, and higher-order components (HOC). Emphasis was placed on maintaining clean architecture, high-quality code, and a visually appealing design.  The application fetches data about astronomy pictures, Mars rovers, near-Earth objects, and Earth imagery.

### Key Features
<li>Full routing support, including a custom 404 page</li>
<li>Smooth navigation</li>
<li>Dynamic data fetching</li>
<li>Animations and interactive visuals</li>
<li>Dark/Light mode toggle</li>
<li>Custom hooks for API requests</li>
<li>Custom higher-order components</li>
<li>Error handling with Error Boundaries</li>

### Technologies used
<li>HTML5, CSS3</li>
<li>TypeScript, React</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Axios</li>
<li>localStorage</li>
<li>Material-UI (MUI), Google Fonts, Vecteezy (for image sources)</li>
<li>NASA Open APIs</li>
<li>Recharts and Leaflet.js (for data visualization)</li>
